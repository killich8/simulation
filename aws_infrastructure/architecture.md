# AWS Infrastructure Design for Road Object Detection Project

This document outlines the AWS infrastructure design for the road object detection project, focusing on scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

## Architecture Overview

The infrastructure is designed to support the following components:
- CARLA simulation for synthetic data generation
- Data processing pipeline for validation, transformation, and augmentation
- Model training with YOLOv5
- Model inference for real-time object detection
- Monitoring and logging

## Infrastructure Components

### Networking
- VPC with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones
- NAT Gateways for outbound internet access from private subnets
- Security groups for fine-grained access control
- VPC Endpoints for secure access to AWS services

### Compute
- EC2 instances for CARLA simulation (GPU-enabled)
- EKS cluster for containerized workloads
- EC2 Auto Scaling groups for dynamic scaling
- Spot instances for cost optimization where appropriate

### Storage
- S3 buckets for:
  - Raw synthetic data
  - Processed data
  - Model artifacts
  - Logs and metrics
- EBS volumes for temporary storage
- EFS for shared file systems

### Security
- IAM roles and policies following principle of least privilege
- KMS for encryption of data at rest
- Security groups for network isolation
- VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring

### Monitoring
- CloudWatch for metrics, logs, and alarms
- Prometheus and Grafana for application-level monitoring
- CloudTrail for API activity logging

## Terraform Structure

The Terraform code is organized as follows:

```
aws_infrastructure/
├── modules/                  # Reusable Terraform modules
│   ├── networking/           # VPC, subnets, security groups
│   ├── compute/              # EC2, EKS, Auto Scaling
│   ├── storage/              # S3, EBS, EFS
│   ├── security/             # IAM, KMS
│   └── monitoring/           # CloudWatch, Prometheus
├── environments/             # Environment-specific configurations
│   ├── dev/                  # Development environment
│   ├── staging/              # Staging environment
│   └── prod/                 # Production environment
└── scripts/                  # Helper scripts
```

## Resource Sizing

### Development Environment
- EC2: 2x g4dn.xlarge for CARLA simulation
- EKS: 3 nodes (t3.large) for containerized workloads
- S3: Standard storage class

### Production Environment
- EC2: 4x g4dn.2xlarge for CARLA simulation
- EKS: 6 nodes (m5.2xlarge) for containerized workloads
- S3: Intelligent-Tiering storage class

## Cost Optimization Strategies
- Use Spot Instances for batch processing
- Implement auto-scaling based on workload
- Lifecycle policies for S3 objects
- Reserved Instances for predictable workloads

## Deployment Strategy
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform
- Configuration management with Ansible
- CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure changes
- Blue/Green deployment for zero-downtime updates

## Security Considerations
- Encryption of data at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and updates
- Network isolation using security groups and NACLs
- Least privilege access control

## Disaster Recovery
- Regular backups of critical data
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Automated recovery procedures
- Documented recovery processes

## Compliance
- Logging and monitoring for audit purposes
- Data encryption for privacy
- Resource tagging for cost allocation
- Regular compliance reviews
